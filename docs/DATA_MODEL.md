# Data model

Code truth: `backend/models.py`, `backend/services/finance.py`, `backend/services/cashflow.py`,
`backend/services/planning/`.

## Users and ownership

App-native auth uses three security tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | Email, display name, role, active flag, password hash, timestamps |
| `user_sessions` | Hashed session tokens, CSRF token hashes, expiry/revocation metadata |
| `audit_events` | Login, logout, user create/update, password reset, and related account events |

The first account created by the app setup flow is an admin. All finance data that belongs to a person is scoped by `user_id`: transactions, bank accounts, import batches, assets, liabilities, holdings, brokerage accounts, job incomes, fixed expenses, subscriptions, planning profiles, and planning runs. Provider tables (`banks`, `brokerages`) and ticker quote cache are global. Admin metrics and the guarded SQL console read from the same SQLite database.

Deleting an account is destructive: the admin API removes that user, their sessions, and all rows in user-owned finance tables. It does not delete global provider/cache tables. The API refuses self-delete and refuses deleting an account only when that account is the final active admin. Inactive admins can be deleted when at least one other active admin remains.

## Net worth

```
other_assets  = sum(Asset.current_value)
portfolio     = sum(holding shares × market price)
liabilities   = sum(Liability.balance_owed)
total_assets  = other_assets + portfolio
net_worth     = total_assets − liabilities
```

Always **current** via `GET /api/net-worth/` (computed from assets + portfolio market value − liabilities).

**Not** derived from transactions, imports, job income, fixed expenses, or subscriptions.

Net worth history is not stored. The current total is exposed only by `GET /api/net-worth/`.

Expenses, income, card payments, rent, utilities, transfers, and bank imports remain
transaction/cashflow data. They only affect net worth after the corresponding current
asset/liability value is updated.

### Avoid double-counting cash

`compute_net_worth()` in `services/finance.py` **adds** `other_assets` (all manual `assets` rows) and **portfolio** (all `holdings` rows valued at market or purchase fallback). There is **no** deduplication between a manual cash/checking asset and brokerage sweep or money-market positions (e.g. **SPAXX**, **SWVXX**, **VMFXX**) that appear in Fidelity or other imports.

| User mistake | Effect on net worth |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Manual “Cash” or checking asset **and** SPAXX (or similar) in `holdings` for the same dollars | Both count toward `total_assets` — **inflated** net worth |
| Only SPAXX in `holdings` (brokerage cash) | Correct if that is where cash lives |
| Only manual `assets` for bank cash | Correct if you do not import sweep positions |

**Guidance:** Pick one representation per pool of money. Either track bank cash as manual assets **or** rely on brokerage CSV positions (including sweeps), not both for the same balance. The app does not infer overlaps; keeping both is allowed and sums both amounts by design.

## Manual balance sheet

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `assets` | Cash accounts, property, vehicles, other (`AssetCategory` enum) |
| `liabilities` | Mortgages, loans, credit cards (`LiabilityCategory` enum) |

Each row has `name`, `category`, value (`current_value` or `balance_owed`), `as_of_date`, optional `notes`.

## Investments

`holdings` — equities/ETFs and brokerage cash sweeps with live/cached prices via `market_data`. Counted inside **portfolio** only; they are **not** subtracted from or merged with manual `assets` (see [Avoid double-counting cash](#avoid-double-counting-cash)).

Optional `brokerage_accounts` / `brokerages` group imported positions; nickname can be set via import API.

## Transactions ledger

Encrypted transaction records — per-user `income` and `expense` (manual or `source=import` from browser-side bank CSV). Powers calendar, dashboard period views, and monthly expense/income totals on the Transactions page. **Does not** update net worth.

The user mostly transacts by card. Rent and utilities can be modeled as fixed expenses (below) rather than only as one-off transactions; neither path directly mutates net worth.

Imports: see [ADDING_A_BANK_IMPORT.md](./ADDING_A_BANK_IMPORT.md). Built-in browser-side bank slugs today: `capital_one`, `chase`, `amex`, `citi`, `x_money`. Brokerage Fidelity plaintext import is retired until moved client-side.

SimpleFIN is the likely future aggregation path. Plaid placeholders may exist in env examples, but Plaid is not the intended integration for this user.

## Recurring cashflow (not net worth)

Separate from the transaction ledger and balance sheet. Code: `models.py`, `services/cashflow.py`, routers `income`, `fixed_expenses`, `subscriptions`, `cashflow`.

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `job_incomes` | Employer/pay configuration (frequency, base pay, bonus/equity, taxes/deductions) |
| `fixed_expenses` | Named recurring bills (rent, utilities, etc.) with frequency and date range |
| `subscriptions` | Recurring subscription amounts with `next_bill_date` |

`GET /api/cashflow/summary?start_date=&end_date=` combines period **transaction** totals with
pro-rated/planned job income and scheduled fixed-expense/subscription occurrences for that range.
This is a cashflow view only: it does **not** write assets, liabilities, holdings, or net worth.

Planning reads recurring annual fixed expenses and subscriptions into its input snapshot for
spending estimates when useful.

## Planning lab (speculative)

Separate from net worth and the transaction ledger. Code: `backend/models.py`, `backend/services/planning/`.

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `planning_assumption_profiles` | Named assumption sets (`payload_json`: returns, spending, tax ids, retirement age, etc.) |
| `planning_scenario_runs` | Schema reserved for persisted runs; **current** `POST /api/planning/v1/runs` returns results with `id=None` and does **not** insert rows |

- **Does not** update `assets`, `liabilities`, `holdings`, `transactions`, or recurring cashflow tables.
- **Does not** affect `GET /api/net-worth/`.
- API: `/api/planning/v1/*` — all responses include speculative disclaimers.
- Only tool wired: `mc_net_worth_paths`.

### Stock Lab scenarios

`stock_lab_scenarios` is an encrypted vault collection, not a plaintext SQL finance table. It stores saved speculative inputs such as primary symbol, comparison symbols, purchase budget, share count, target price, return assumptions, dividend assumptions, and projection horizon.

Stock Lab scenarios do not mutate holdings, assets, liabilities, transactions, recurring cashflow, or net worth. Public ticker research is cached separately as symbol-level market data and must not include user budgets, share counts, scenario names, holdings IDs, or user IDs.
